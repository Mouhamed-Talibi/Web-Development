<!-- resources/views -->
- This is the folder where all the views are stored. 
- Views are the files that are returned by the controller. 
- They are the files that are displayed to the user. 
- The views are written in HTML and PHP.

<!-- routes | Requeste Types -->
- Get    : read a resource
- Post   : create a resource
- Put    : update a resource ( full update )
- Patch  : update a resource ( partial update )
- Delete : delete a resource

* uri must be unique
* view function : it call the view file

<!-- Passing Data to the View -->
- The view function can accept an array as a second argument.
- view ('welcome', ['name' => 'Samantha']);

<!-- Dynamic variable -->
- Route::get('/hello/ { var_name }', function ($var_name) {
    return view('hello', [ 'var_name' => $var_name ]);
});

[ Using request object ]
------------------------
- Route::get('/{varname}', function (Request $request) {
    dd ($request->varname);
    return view("index", ['varname' => $request->varname]);
});

[ Getting Vars By Compact Method ]
----------------------------------
- compact : it is a php function that creates an array from the variables that are passed to it.
- Route::get('/{varname}', function ($varname) {
    return view("index", compact('varname'));
});

<!-- debugging function -->
- dd($var_name) : it will display the variable and stop the execution of the code.
- dump($var_name) : it will display the variable and continue the execution of the code.

<!-- Controller ( app/http/controllers ) -->
- it is a class that contains methods that are called "actions" or "methods".

<!-- Using Controler In Routing -->
Route::get('/', ['\nameSpace\controllerName', 'actionName'] );
    exmaple : 
        Route::get("/", ['\App\Http\Controllers\homeController', 'home']);

[ Best method ]
---------------
Route::get('/', [controllerName::class, 'methodName']);

<!-- Blade -->
- Blade is a templating engine that is included with Laravel.
- We can write php code in the balde template 
- Best Practice : 
    - use blade syntax as much as possible
    - use php code only when necessary

    * {{ var_name }} 
        : this how we print the data using blade template 

    <!-- foreach -->
    * @foreach ($var_name as $var) 
        : this is how we loop through the data using blade template
    * @ endforeach 
        : this is how we end the loop

    <!-- if statement -->
    * @if 
        : this is how we write if statement using blade template
    * @else 
        : this is how we write else statement using blade template 
    * @endif
        : this is how we end the if statement

    <!-- unless -->
    * unless
        : it is the opposite of if statement 
            It is used for one time 
    * endunless 
        : it is the opposite of endif statement

    <!-- isset -->
    * @isset($var_name)
        : it is used to check if the variable is set or not
    * @endisset
        : it is used to end the isset statement

    <!-- switch -->
    * @switch ($var_name)
        : it is used to check multiple conditions
        * @case('value')    
            : it is used to check the value of the variable
            * @break
                : it is used to break the switch statement
        * @default 
            : it is used to set the default value 
    * @endswitch
        : it is used to end the switch statement

    <!-- empty -->
    * @empty($var_name)
        : it is used to check if the variable is empty or not	
    * @endempty
        : it is used to end the empty statement

    <!-- php -->
    * @php   
        : it is used to write php code in the blade template
    * @endphp
        : it is used to end the php statement

    <!-- include -->
    * @include ('path_to_file')
        : it is used to include the file in the blade template
            replace the / by the . in the path

    * @includeIf ('path_to_file')
        : it is used to include the file if it exists

    * @includeWhen ($var_name, 'path_to_file')
        : it is used to include the file when the condition is true

    * @includeFirst (['path_to_file1', 'path_to_file2'])
        : it is used to include the first file that exists

    <!-- once -->
    * @once
        : it is used to include the file only once
    * @endoce 
        : it is used to end the once statement

    <!-- extends -->
    * @extends ('layout_name')
        : it is used to extend the layout

    <!-- yeild -->
    * @yeild ('sectionName', 'defaultValue')
        : defines a placeholder for a Blade template section.

    <!-- section -->
    * @section('sectionName')
        : defines a section in a Blade template for content.
    * @endsection 
        : ending the section blade
