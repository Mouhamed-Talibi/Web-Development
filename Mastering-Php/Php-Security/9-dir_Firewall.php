        - Directory Firewall :
        ----------------------
            * when you're working on a client project, it is important to firewall the project directory 
                because he project you're working on must be online to allow the client see his site and tell you about the edits you've to do
            * when you have a hosting for yoru site 
                - enter the cpanel for this hosting 
                - search for directory privacy  
                - always your site data is in the www folder so enter it
                - select the folder you want to secure 
                - set a password for this directory 
                - create a username and password for your client to enter to his site to test it 
            * it is good to create a firewall for the admin panel of the website
