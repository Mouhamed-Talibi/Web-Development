	As a PHP backend developer, there are several recommended skills you should have to be effective in the role. Here's a list of key skills:

	1. PHP Mastery
		PHP Fundamentals: Solid understanding of core PHP syntax, control structures, functions, error handling, and object-oriented programming (OOP).
		PHP Frameworks: Familiarity with popular PHP frameworks like Laravel, Symfony, or CodeIgniter for efficient development and following best practices.

	2. Database Management
		SQL: Ability to write complex queries, optimize them, and manage databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MariaDB.
		Database Design: Know how to design efficient relational databases, normalize tables, and understand indexing for performance improvement.
		NoSQL (optional): Understanding of NoSQL databases like MongoDB for certain projects.

	3. Version Control (Git)
		Master Git for version control, branching, and collaboration, especially when working in a team.
		Knowledge of platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

	4. RESTful API Development
		Ability to build and consume RESTful APIs to enable communication between the backend and frontend or other services.
		Familiarity with JSON and XML formats.

	5. Security Practices
		Understand security fundamentals like preventing SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), and ensuring data encryption.
		Best practices for user authentication and authorization, such as OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Tokens), and password hashing.

	6. Web Servers
		Knowledge of configuring and working with Apache or Nginx servers, and understanding how PHP interacts with them.
		Ability to manage server settings, performance optimization, and debugging server-related issues.

	7. Composer
		Understanding of Composer, PHP's dependency manager, to handle external libraries and package management efficiently.

	8. Understanding of MVC Architecture
		Familiarity with Model-View-Controller (MVC) design patterns, especially if working with frameworks like Laravel or Symfony.

	9. Error Handling & Debugging
		Ability to log, track, and debug errors efficiently.

	10. DevOps Basics
		Knowledge of deploying applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku.
		Experience with CI/CD pipelines to automate testing, building, and deployment.

	11. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Basics
		While backend-focused, basic understanding of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is important to interact with the frontend team.
		Familiarity with AJAX requests to handle asynchronous data updates between frontend and backend.

	12. Caching & Performance Optimization
		Knowledge of caching mechanisms like Redis, Memcached, or using PHP Opcache to improve application performance.
		Understanding how to reduce server load, optimize database queries, and enhance response times.

	13. Soft Skills
		Problem-solving and critical thinking: Essential for debugging and optimizing code.
		Collaboration and communication: Important when working in teams with designers, frontend developers, and project managers.
		Building expertise in these areas will make you a highly competitive PHP backend developer, even without formal certification.
