MY SQL JOINING TABLES : 
--------------------------------------------
	
	- A JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

exemple : 	SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customers.CustomerName, Orders.OrderDate
	FROM Orders
	INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID=Customers.CustomerID;

exemple :  SELECT students.name , students.student_id , notes.note
    	FROM students
    	INNER JOIN notes ON students.student_id = notes.id

- Supported Types of Joins in MySQL : 

	INNER JOIN  : Returns records that have matching values in both tables
	LEFT JOIN     : Returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
	RIGHT JOIN  : Returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
	CROSS JOIN  : Returns all records from both tables

the synthax od the INNER JOIN : 
----------------------------------------------
	SELECT   column_name(s)
	FROM      table1
	INNER JOIN    table2
	ON     table1.column_name = table2.column_name;
!! The INNER JOIN keyword selects all rows from both tables as long as there is a match between the columns. If there are records in the "Orders" table that do not have matches in "Customers", these orders will not be shown!
