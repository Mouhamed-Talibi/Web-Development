            <b>Atomic Habits</b>
            <i><h4>Review: : </h4></i>
            <h5>
                "Atomic Habits" by <b>James Clear </b>attempts to break down the science of habits and show you how small changes can lead to big results. The central idea is that tiny habits can be more powerful than big goals. Clear works to provide a framework for creating good habits and breaking bad ones that centers around building systems rather than relying on motivation or self-discipline.
                The framework centers around the "Four Laws of Behavior Change", which are to make habits obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying. By implementing strategies that align with these "laws," Clear says you can overcome common obstacles and make lasting changes in your life.

            <i><b>Review:</b></i>
            <h6>
                ‘Don’t Believe Everything You Think’ is not about rewiring your brain, rewriting your past, positive thinking or anything of the sort.
                We cannot solve our problems with the same level of consciousness that created them. Tactics are temporary. An expansion of consciousness is permanen

                Surrounded by Idiots is an international phenomenon, selling over 1.5 million copies worldwide. It offers a simple, yet ground-breaking method for assessing the personalities of people we communicate with – in and out of the office – based on four personality types (Red, Blue, Green and Yellow), and provides insights into how we can adjust the way we speak and share information.

            <b>The Psychology Of Money</b>
            <br>
            <br>
            <i><b>Review:</b></i>
            <h6>
                Doing well with money isn’t necessarily about what you know. It’s about how you behave. And behavior is hard to teach, even to really smart people.
                Money―investing, personal finance, and business decisions―is typically taught as a math-based field, where data and formulas tell us exactly what to do. But in the real world people don’t make financial decisions on a spreadsheet. They make them at the dinner table, or in a meeting room, where personal history, your own unique view of the world, ego, pride, marketing, and odd incentives are scrambled together.
